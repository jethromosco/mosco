Enhance products.py and transactions.py by adding a dropdown selector system for Category → Sub-category → Unit:

Dropdown behavior:

Populate dropdowns based on the existing categories structure.

Sub-category and Unit are optional:

If a category has no sub-category or unit, the dropdowns should be disabled or skipped.

Selecting a category without sub-category/unit should go directly to the corresponding table.

The dropdowns should dynamically update: selecting a category filters sub-categories, selecting sub-category filters units.

Behavior on selection / button press:

After selecting Category → Sub-category → Unit and pressing a button:

Access the database corresponding to the chosen category.

Open the transaction_window and the admin page for that database.

Existing functionality for adding products or transactions should remain exactly the same.

The UI/UX should follow all current design patterns, layouts, fonts, colors, spacing, and field alignment.

Admin folder integration:

The code or UI added for Oilseals and Monoseals under the admin folder should be identical in structure and behavior.

Only the database linking should differ (each pointing to its own category’s database).

This setup will be the template for future categories, so the structure, field layout, and controls must be reusable.

Constraints / Requirements:

Do not delete, rename, or move any existing files.

Maintain all existing logic and database functionality.

Changes should be additive and backward-compatible.

Optional dropdowns must handle missing sub-categories or units gracefully.

Goal:

Allow the admin to quickly select any category/subcategory/unit, open the correct database, and proceed with transactions or product management without breaking current behavior.

Establish a standardized admin module for Oilseals and Monoseals that can be reused for all future categories, with only database linking needing adjustment.


Add and integrate the new **Category → Sub-category → Unit selector feature** so that it is **clearly accessible from the Admin flow** and not hidden or unreachable in the UI.

### Required Admin access flow (must be exact)

1. From the main app, when the **Admin password is entered correctly**, the app must open the **Admin window**.
2. The Admin window must continue to show the existing **Products** and **Transactions** sections exactly as they work now.
3. **At the top of the Admin window**, above the Products and Transactions content, add the new **Category → Sub-category → Unit selector** feature so the admin can immediately see and use it.

### Selector behavior

* The selector consists of:

  * Category dropdown
  * Sub-category dropdown (optional)
  * Unit dropdown (optional)
* Dropdowns must be populated dynamically based on the existing `categories` structure.
* If a selected category does not have a sub-category or unit:

  * The corresponding dropdown(s) must be disabled or hidden.
  * Selecting the category should immediately route to the correct table/database.
* Changing the selection must update the active database context.

### Behavior after selection

* After selecting Category → Sub-category → Unit (or just Category if others are not required):

  * The app must connect to the **database associated with that selection**.
  * The **Products view** and **Transactions view** must automatically reflect the selected database.
  * Opening the transaction window or adding/editing products must proceed exactly as it currently does, but against the selected database.

### Admin folder consistency (very important)

* Any code, UI, or logic added under the `admin` folder for **Oilseals** and **Monoseals** must be **identical in structure and behavior**.
* The **only difference** between Oilseals and Monoseals implementations should be:

  * Which database they connect to.
* This shared structure will be the **template for future categories**, so avoid category-specific hacks or branching logic.

### Constraints (must not be violated)

* Do NOT delete, rename, or move any existing files.
* Do NOT change existing filenames.
* Do NOT break current Products or Transactions functionality.
* Follow existing UI/UX principles exactly (layout, spacing, alignment, fonts, button styles).
* All changes must be additive and backward-compatible.

### Goal

After entering the Admin password, the admin must immediately see:

* The Admin window
* The Products and Transactions sections
* The new Category → Sub-category → Unit selector at the top

From there, the admin can select a category and seamlessly manage products and transactions for the correct database without navigating elsewhere.


I added a new module for **Monoseals**, but it is not working correctly because it is still being treated as part of **Packing Seals** instead of being routed properly as its own sub-module.

The goal is to add and manage data specifically for **Monoseals (mm)**.

Monoseals must follow the **same architecture, logic, UI patterns, and controller behavior as Oilseals** (same type of inventory screen, transaction handling, database access, fullscreen frame behavior, and navigation), **but they must live under Packing Seals**. This is why their folder structure is intentionally similar to Oilseals.

### Required navigation behavior (must be exact)

When the app is opened, the navigation flow must be:

Packing Seals
→ Monoseals
→ MM

At the final step, the app must open and display the screen defined in:

packingseals/monoseals/ui/mm.py

The `mm.py` file must be treated as the entry screen for **Monoseals (mm)**, in the same way that `oilseals/main.py` or equivalent entry files are handled.

### Structural requirements

* `packingseals/monoseals/` must be a **first-class module**, not implicitly grouped or hard-coded under another seal type
* The folder structure under `packingseals/monoseals/` should mirror Oilseals where applicable (ui/, admin/, database access, transactions, photos, etc.)
* `packingseals/monoseals/ui/mm.py` must be the canonical route and import target for Monoseals (mm)

### Navigation and controller rules

* Navigation must be handled through the existing **controller-based fullscreen frame system**
* Only one frame should be visible at a time
* Back/Home navigation must continue to work exactly as it does for Oilseals
* No new windowing logic (no new Toplevels unless already part of fallback behavior)

### Compatibility constraints (very important)

* **Do not break any existing links, imports, or navigation**
* Existing modules (Oilseals, Packing Seals, others) must continue working without modification to their behavior
* Any necessary changes must be done by **following the new structure**, not by adding hacks, hard-coded paths, or special cases
* Imports should be updated safely to reflect the new structure while preserving backward compatibility where required

### What is allowed

* Updating import paths to align with the new folder structure
* Refactoring routing logic to properly register Monoseals (mm) as its own selectable screen
* Reusing Oilseals logic and UI patterns where appropriate

### What is NOT allowed

* Changing existing UI layouts or visual design
* Changing existing database logic unless strictly required for correct routing
* Introducing duplicate logic that already exists for Oilseals
* Breaking controller navigation or fullscreen behavior

### End result

Monoseals (mm) must behave exactly like Oilseals in functionality and UX, but be correctly accessed through:

Packing Seals → Monoseals → MM

and load its screen exclusively from:

packingseals/monoseals/ui/mm.py
